Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases worldwide and is a major cause of death from cancer . Lung carcinomas are classified by histopathologic subtype (the Fig below). Nonâ€“small cell lung cancers account for around 85% of cases and of these adenocarcinomas (LAC) are the most common . Incidence of LAC has increased over the past 30 years and it presents frequently in asymptomatic females especially those from East Asia, and often in nonsmokers.
